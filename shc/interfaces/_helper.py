    Abstract base class for client interfaces, providing run task supervision and automatic reconnects.

    This class can be used as a base class for client interface implementations to simplify error handling and automatic
    reconnection attempts. The core of its functionality is the `_supervise` Task. It is started at interface `start()`
    and runs until shutdown of the interface. It starts and supervises the implementation-specific :meth:`_run` Task,
    which typically contains a loop for handling incoming messages. In addition, it calls :meth:`_connect` **before**
    and :meth:`_subscribe` **after** starting the run task. If the run task exits unexpectedly and
    :attr:`auto_reconnect` is enabled, reconnecting the interface via `_connect`, `_run` and `_subscribe` is attempted.
    For shutting down the interface (and stopping the run task in case of a subscribe error), `_disconnect` must be
    implemented in such a way, that it shuts down the run task.

    This class inherits from :class:`SubscribableStatusInterface` to publish the current status of the supervised client
    as monitoring status. However, it only updates the :attr:`status <shc.supervisor.InterfaceStatus.status>` and
    :attr:`message <shc.supervisor.InterfaceStatus.message>` attributes of the `InterfaceStatus`, but does not touch the
    `metrics`. So, you can fill the `metrics` with custom values from your derived interface class via
