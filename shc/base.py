        Method to publish a new value to all subscribers and trigger all registered logic handlers.

        All logic handlers and :meth:`Writable.write` methods are called in parallel asyncio tasks, which are **not**
        awaited to return. If `_stateful_publishing` is True on this object (or class), it will keep track of the
        currently pending publishing tasks. This information is then used to mitigate state inconsistencies, caused by
        value updates crossing over each other, by resetting the `origin` of following value updates to the respective
        subscribers (with pending tasks). This disables the usual loop prevention and causes the value update to travel
        back its originating path. Consequently, the update will override the intermediate conflicting value in all
        places.

        Additionally, these updates with resetted origin are delayed for a random delay up to
        :data:`MAX_CONCURRENT_UPDATE_DELAY` seconds (and skipped if overtaken by another update in that time) to avoid
        endless update loops of two competing value updates. To avoid unnecessary value updates flying around, we limit
        the origin resetting to value updates that reached this object via another path as the pending updates to the
        subscriber and value updates that already result from republishing with resetted origin. Other updates should
        not be prone to conflicts due to the ordered asyncio task queue.

        `_stateful_publishing` should be enabled for all objects that are *Subscribable* and *Writable* (i.e. allows
        sending and receiving value updates) and have either internal state (like Variables) or represent an external,
        stateful (or quasi-stateful) system (like a Connector object for a KNX group address/an MQTT topic). On the
        other hand, objects, that are only *Subscribable*, should not use `_stateful_publishing`.

        If the object only forwards value updates without storing a state, it should await the successful publishing of
        the value by using the :meth:`_publish_and_wait` coroutine.
